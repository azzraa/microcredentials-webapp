# microcredentials-webapp

# Description
This project is about developing a mini app to digitize microcredentials, aligning with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations). The app simplifies the process of issuing, applying for and evaluating microcredentials through a structured, web-based system.
The app will support three roles: Creators design and define credentials, Users apply by submitting work, skills and supporting documents and Evaluators review applications to approve or provide feedback.
